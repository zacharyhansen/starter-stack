          Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a very lazy king who
          spent all day lounging on his throne. One day, his advisors came to
          him with a problem: the kingdom was running out of money.
        </TypographyP>
        <TypographyH2 className="mt-10 scroll-m-20 border-b pb-2 text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight transition-colors first:mt-0">
          The Kings Plan
        </TypographyH2>
        <TypographyP>
          The king thought long and hard, and finally came up with
          {/* eslint-disable-next-line jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid, sonarjs/anchor-is-valid */}
          <a
            href="#"
            className="text-primary font-medium underline underline-offset-4"
          >
            a brilliant plan
          </a>
          : he would tax the jokes in the kingdom.
        </TypographyP>
        <TypographyBlockquote>
          After all, he said, everyone enjoys a good joke, so its only fair that
          they should pay for the privilege.
        </TypographyBlockquote>
        <TypographyH3>The Joke Tax</TypographyH3>
        <TypographyP>
          The kings subjects were not amused. They grumbled and complained, but
          the king was firm:
        </TypographyP>
        <TypographyList>
          <TypographyListItem>
            1st level of puns: 5 gold coins
          </TypographyListItem>
          <TypographyListItem>
            2nd level of jokes: 10 gold coins
          </TypographyListItem>
          <TypographyListItem>
            3rd level of one-liners : 20 gold coins
          </TypographyListItem>
        </TypographyList>
        <TypographyP>
          As a result, people stopped telling jokes, and the kingdom fell into a
          gloom. But there was one person who refused to let the kings
          foolishness get him down: a court jester named Jokester.
        </TypographyP>
        <TypographyH3 className="mt-8 scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">
          Jokesters Revolt
        </TypographyH3>
        <TypographyP>
          Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and
          leaving jokes all over the place: under the kings pillow, in his soup,
          even in the royal toilet. The king was furious, but he couldnt seem to
          stop Jokester.
        </TypographyP>
        <TypographyP>
          And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the jokes
          left by Jokester were so funny that they couldnt help but laugh. And
          once they started laughing, they couldnt stop.
        </TypographyP>
        <TypographyH3 className="mt-8 scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">
          The Peoples Rebellion
        </TypographyH3>
        <TypographyP>
          The people of the kingdom, feeling uplifted by the laughter, started
          to tell jokes and puns again, and soon the entire kingdom was in on
          the joke.
        </TypographyP>
        <TypographyTable />
        <TypographyP>
          The king, seeing how much happier his subjects were, realized the
          error of his ways and repealed the joke tax. Jokester was declared a
          hero, and the kingdom lived happily ever after.
        </TypographyP>
        <TypographyP>
          The moral of the story is: never underestimate the power of a good
          laugh and always be careful of bad ideas.
        </TypographyP>
